# Fintech540-Machine Learning For Fintech - Group_projet:smiling_imp:

## Description:
This is repo for a Machine learning Model-building project that takes cryptocurrency data as input and used some supervised(regression,classification) and unsupervised(density astimation, clustering) machine learning algorithms to find out some interesting patterns in the dataset.

## Architecture:

## Motivation:
Machine learning in finance is now considered a key aspect of several financial services and applications, including managing assets, evaluating levels of risk, calculating credit scores, and even approving loans. Machine learning is a subset of data science that provides the ability to learn and improve from experience without being programmed.\
In this project, we will explore some possible ways that how unsupervised learnig algorithms(Clustering) could be applied on cryptocurrency and access their performance to find out whether there are some interesting discoveries.

## Take a peep into our dataset:
You can find out dataset here: web_link
For dataset, we have `1243590` entries and `12` columns:
> - `time_open` : 
> - `time_high` :
> - `time_low` :
> - `quote.USD.open` : 
> - `quote.USD.high` : 
> - `quote.USD.low` : 
> - `quote.USD.close` :
> - `quote.USD.volume` : 
> - `quote.USD.market_cap` : 
> - `quote.USD.timestamp` :
> - `symbol` :
> - `id` :

## Addtional Notes:
We might not try out all machine learning algorithms at the first stage. We might focus on unsupervised learning algorithm such as `clustering`.

## Progress:
- [x] README file and some EDA work
- [ ] Assign works
- [ ] Building models 
- [ ] Interpret the results
- [ ] Make PPT
